# KNOWN ISSUES
on home page the picker views are partially hidden in the UI. when testing on a device this does not happen. not sure why.
just added tests
did lots of modularizing. there's a chance one of the new files may not have transferred. if that is the case please message me at codingwithameen@gmail.com

in order to play the sounds you will have to download them from dropbox and move them into the Shared/Sounds folder. You will probably have to create the folder in the shared directory. make sure both the apple watch and iphone targets have access to it.
Have not gotten to any apple watch modularization or tests
