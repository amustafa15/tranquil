# KNOWN ISSUES
on home page the picker views are partially hidden in the UI. when testing on a device this does not happen. not sure why.
just added tests
did lots of modularizing. there's a chance one of the new files may not have transferred. if that is the case please message me at codingwithameen@gmail.com

in order to play the sounds you will have to download them from dropbox and move them into the Shared/Sounds folder.
Have not gotten to any apple watch modularization or tests
